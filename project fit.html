                            <li>Mentioned that if they had friends that supported and came along for their workouts then they would go more frequently, especially those who were still new to gyming. </li>

The navigation bar then leads users to the collections page, providing a variety of workouts and recipes for users to explore and use. The rewards page incentivizes users to experiment with different activities in exchange for points that can be redeemed for prizes. </p></div><br><br>

                       we chose to get evaluated by three users from our user base who vary in physical activity levels,
                       a fitness rookie, enthusiast, and a competitive athlete. Each user was given specific directions to schedule a new workout and search for information on their body composition. </p><br><br>

                    <p> After conducting user testing, Kalvin liked and stressed the importance of viewing his friends' activity and schedule which he believed would motivate him to go more frequently to the gym. Another aspect that Kalvin liked was the idea of earning rewards, although was weary of the idea of rankings, which could inherently make people feel less inclined to join.</p><br><br>

                    <br> <p>Prior to conducting user testing on Bernice, we added an additional feature which allows the user the option to join their friends workout. After Bernice had completed the first task she was interested in clicking on the button to join a friend’s workout. This functionality improves the user’s experience because it creates an interaction between users. Instead of just being able to view their friends’ workouts the user can now take action and join them.</p> <br><br>

                    <p> This user testing on Taly proved our hypothesis that seeing friends’ workout plans motivate users with competitive nature to be more active as well. However, Taly also told us that our competitor ClassPass has just updated their app a few days ago to include friends’ feed as well. But she said she liked that we use points to quantify users’ fitness journey. However, Taly also tells us that not everyone is competitive like her and sometimes seeing other people excelling might discourage beginners to get started, which is something we will keep in mind and modify in our next stage. </p><br><br>

                  <li> Difficulties with setting the date & time: minor bugs on mobile devices and “computer language” format. </li>
                  <li>Users tend to go through all the information on each page first before performing the task. This could mean that they are interested in exploring our app, and this could also imply that we need to make the key features stand out more to save the user’s browsing time.</li>
                  <li>All three users were intrigued by the social feed of their friends’ activities, especially after we added the new feature to join someone else’s workout.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p class="para1">Overall, the user testing session provided us with insightful feedback, using the patterns we found to continue developing its social related features and improving usability to attract potential users. </p><br><br>

                    <p class="para1">For our app’s visual design, we decided to go with a minimalistic approach, incorporating many pieces using the iOS user interface elements. <br></p>
					<img src="img/fb/styleguide.png" class="styleguide" alt="fitbuddy style guide">
					<br><br><p class="para1">For example, we chose to use the iOS icons for our buttons and adopted SF Pro Text since it’s a very clean and easy-to-read font. We were also inspired by the notifications containers in iOS design and repeatedly used those for workout schedules and user profiles to ensure consistency. 
					For our “Collections” page, we learned from the layout designs in Google search results, Yelp, and ClassPass to pack all the essential information while preserving large image cards, because a picture is worth a thousand words.

                    <p class="para1">This is our finished, coded prototype for Fitbuddy. We arrived at this high fidelity prototype by iterating on our Figma version of the app, guided by our user feedback, and simultaneously coding it as well.</p><br>

                     <p class="para2">From the evaluations of our instructor and peers throughout the different iterations of our prototype, we were able to improve the usability and functionality of the app by combining similar features and adding necessary instructions. We also enhanced the aesthetics of the app to add more visual cues that could diminish user errors, such as adding shadows under clickable buttons and highlighting CTAs. </p>

                    <p class="para1">I couldn’t have accomplished this without my teammates: Lisa and Felicity. Our team and I have learned how to rapidly implement a user interface and use user centered design techniques from this project. Had we had more time and resources, we would have continued to add the other features from our figma version, especially the ability to save links from our collections page onto the coded prototype. We also hoped to expand on giving users a personalized summary of their workout history and complete another round of user testing to supplement our design choices. Moving forward, I take from this experience the principles of user experience design from testing and creating the prototype to evaluating others.</p>
