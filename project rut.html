                   <p class="para1">The COVID-19 pandemic has created a situation unprecedented in the history of the human race. Never before has such a high-percentage of the world’s population been isolated in their homes. At the same time, the internet has enabled many to continue to connect for work and play. For many others, the situation has led to stress and uncertainty. Understanding and addressing these challenges not only helps people in the current situation, but could help society prepare for future crises. </p><br>

               <p class="para1">Our team began our research phase by conducting secondary research and online community observations where members discuss their situation isolating at home. From our findings, we saw an increase in the need for mental health support.</p><br>
               <p class="para1"><b>What we know:</b></p>
               <ul>
                  <li>Contagion concerns can worsen anxiety and ‘contamination obsessions’ for those with obsessive/compulsive issues</li>
                  <li>Ultimate consequence to uptick in mental health issues due to this crisis: rise in self-harm/suicide</li>
                  <li>Disruption to routine, sleep disturbances, cutoff of social contact seen to negatively impact individuals’ health</li>
                  <li>Social isolation and uncertain times can cause mental health to worsen, or disorders to return</li>
                  <li>Humans are social creatures who thrive on contact with others</li>
            </ul><br>
            <p class="para1">Online Observation on Communities such as: reddit, mental health message boards/forums, facebook groups, etc.</p><br>
            <img src="img/rut/quote.png" class="quote center" alt="quote"><br><br>
            <p>Many people have posted similar anecdotes to reddit pages (threads such as r/living-alone, etc.), detailing their experiences in isolation. Many, like this reddit user, expressed sentiments of guilt for unproductivity as well as their wishes for coping mechanisms, specifically methods of warding off negative, unwanted thoughts (stemming from whatever: general anxiety/depression, restlessness, boredom, and loneliness).  </p><br><br>

               <p class="para1">The team then created an online questionnaire for individuals who have adapted to home isolation to find opportunities for an application. Through this questionnaire, we aimed to gather information regarding how people are handling social isolation in the context of mental health. We wanted to learn about the resources people are using to cope, and how this affects their daily activities and mindset.</p><br>

                  <li>Majority of people have found their mental health to be worsening during this time, they have indicated this to be due to changes in routine and an abrupt change to their access to their support systems</li>
                  <li>Those who have found their mental health to be improving note it is due to being able to dedicate more time to themselves and focusing on creating a schedule and expectations for themselves</li><br></ul>

            <p class="quotes">Yes, <u>worsening</u> - “Not being able to physically spend time with people is hard, I can’t go out and about to some activities like thrifting that I do when I’m feeling out of sorts. I think a lot of my friends are also overwhelmed dealing with everything so it’s been harder to lean on them for support.”</p>

                  <li>A majority of people,50, have found that quarantine has affected the way they connect with their support systems, with mostly, 28, connecting more frequently</li>
                  <li>Some have indicated they have trouble connecting with their loved ones due to lack of motivation or distaste for the lack of physical touch</li>
                  <li>Those who are connecting more frequently have been reaching out for mutual support and to obtain the human interaction they cannot obtain physically</li>
