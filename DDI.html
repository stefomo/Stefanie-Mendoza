            Over 10 weeks my group and I, along with the help from mentors Gayle Lorenzi, RN, CDCES, Arizona Milotich, Dr. Lars Mueller, and Heidi Rataj designed an interactive visual tool for both healthcare providers and patients to support their learning of diabetes management.</b></p>
            <br> 
           
             <p class="para2 x-callout">Our mission was to make diabetes, specifically the relationship between insulin and glucose, easier to understand and manage. We wanted our project to focus on allowing people to see their diabetes in a clear, digestible way, and therefore focused on interactive visualizations as a learning tool.</p>

                   <p class="para2">Diabetes Technology like continous glucose monitors (CGM) and Insulin Pumps makes huge amounts of data available to people with diabetes. This data allows people to understand how diabetes affects their body and understanding this data can lead to a more effective diabetes management. <b class="highlight">However, there is little support and a lack of tools to help people with diabetes understand essential diabetes concepts.</b></p><br><br>

               <p class="para2"> Living with diabetes can be stressful. On top of the physical, emotional, and financial challenges, once a person is diagnosed, there is an overwhelming amount of information they need to learn and understand quickly in order to manage a healthy lifestyle: Figuring out food intake, complex carbs, exercising, the technology, the side effects of medication, and more.</p><br><br>

               <center><h5><b>So what methods and tools are people using to learn and teach about diabetes?</b></h5></center><br><br>

The patient learns in real-time but, what if they have questions?

         <h1> <span class="highlight">User Research</span></h1> <br>

            <p class="para2">To further understand the core problems within diabetes education, our team dove into this domain by conducting research and interviews with two health care providers and four continous monitoring (CGM)/pump users to discover possible solutions for teaching and learning. </p><br><br>

            <h5 class="call-out-text" >Here are the four key insights we learned:</h5> <br>
        <!---- 1--->
                <p class="para2"><b> 1. Lack of Visual Learning Tools</b><br>
			         Healthcare providers rely on impromptu drawings to explain important concepts</p>
			   <br>
         <!---- 2--->
			     <p class="para2"><b>2. Information Overload</b><br>
               Patients expressed that when first approaching diabetes, simple is better </p>
               <p class="quotes">“It was so overwhelming. [During] the first appointment, it’s like I blacked out. I just barely remember sticking myself with a needle.”</p> <p class="pp">-Participant T, T1D and Diabetes Educator</p><br>
         <!---- 3--->
            <p class="para2"><b>3. Long Trial and Error Phase</b><br>
			  Pump users went through a long trial and error phase to understand insulin timing</p>
             <p class="quotes">“If you’re newly diagnosed, there is a lot of testing and trial and error to get to where I am. There is a steep learning curve and lots of frustrations”</p><p class="pp">-Participant M, TP1</p><br>
        <!---- 4--->
			 <p class="para2"> 4. <b>Pre-Bolusing is a Challenging Concept</b><br>
			  Pre-bolusing is a relatively new concept and people are sometimes reluctant to try it. </p> <br><br>


 			<p class="para2">After considering these four essential points, our team distilled these insights into a single, guiding question as the primary focus of our tool's development.</p><br>

            <h5 class="x-callout"><b>How might we help CGM & pump users better understand and manage insulin timing and dosing? </h5></b></p>

             <p class="para2">The initial ideation process focused on three opportunity points gathered from the user research that the team and I developed into sketches. We needed to create a visual tool which effectively conveyed key concepts to people with diabetes without overwhelming or confusing them, but provided them with enough context and information.</p> <br><br>

             <Center><p class="figure">Fig. 3. Rapid ideation sketches.</p></Center><br><br>

             <h5 class="call-out-text">Three opportunity points we developed into possible solutions:</h5><br>
             <p class="para2"><b>1. Understanding Insulin Timing and Dosing</b><br>Healthcare providers stressed understanding insulin is essential. So we created a sliding graph to represent the changes in timing and dosing</p><br>
             <p class="para2"><b>2. Providing Personalized Care</b><br>Adjusting relevant insights and feedback to the person personalizes their experience. Through inputting personal cgm data, users could see an example of how their blood sugars would react </p><br>
             <p class="para2"><b>3. Using Visual Explanations</b><br>Rather than paper, simple digital interactive learning tools are better. Providing users with a story could help people with diabetes better visualize and instill important diabetes concepts</p><br><br>

             <p class="para2 x-callout">Although there are many concepts to teach for diabetes management, we decided to focus our tool on teaching the importance of insulin timing and dosing for glucose levels. By keeping the tool simple, we are able to hone in the key insulin concept. </p><br><center>

        <p class="para2"><b>4. Visualize Insulin Activity</b><br>Showing the immediate effects of insulin pushing down on glucose levels is essential to understanding patterns.</p><br>
