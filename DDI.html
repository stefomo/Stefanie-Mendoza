    <!------- 2 --------->
    			<p class="para6"><b>2. Information Overload</b><br></p>
                <p class="para7"> Patients expressed that when first learning about such a complex condition as diabetes, keeping it simple is best. </p><br>

    <!---- 3 -------->
            <p class="para6"><b>3. Long Trial and Error Phase</b><br></p> <p class="para7">
			  A lot of insulin pump users underwent a long, frustrating trial-and-error phase to in order to understand insulin timing</p>

               <center><div class="bubble2 left" style="margin-right: 25%;">“If you’re newly diagnosed, there is a lot of testing and trial-and-error to get to where I am. There is a steep learning curve and lots of frustrations” - Participant M. T1D </div></center><br><br>

    <!------- 4 -------->
			 <p class="para6"> 4. <b>Pre-Bolusing is a Challenging Concept</b><br></p>  <p class="para7">
			  Pre-bolusing is a relatively new concept and patients are reluctant to try it since they don’t know all the details </p> <br><br>


 			<p class="para4">After considering these four essential points, our team distilled these insights into a single, guiding question as the primary focus of our tool's development.</p>

             <p class="para6"><b>3. Using Visual Explanations</b><br><span class="para2">Contrary to static paper drawings, digital interactive learning tools can be dynamic.

        <p class="para6"><b>2. Simplify User Interface</b><br><span class="para2">The tool should be intuitive without a tutorial, it should not further complicate the UX nor require the user to spend additional time learning another concept on top of diabetes</span></p><br>

        <p class="para6"><b>3. Optimize Graphs</b><br><span class="para2">Graphs should be dynamic and match various insulin dose change scenarios.</span></p><br>
