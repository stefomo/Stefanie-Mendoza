This tool aims to address the challenges faced by patients with gestational diabetes using a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) device, that can be integrated into the Dexcom system. The tool was designed to educate women about their condition and simplify the management of diabetes during pregnancy.</p>

         <h1> <span class="highlight3 titledex">Background Information</span></h1> <br>

         <h4>Who is Dexcom and what is a CGM? <br><br>

            <p class="para2">Dexcom is a company from San Diego, California that produces and manufactures (CGM) continuous glucose monitors. CGM produces up to 288 daily blood glucose values that allow the detection of glucose patterns that would be impossible to notice with 5-7 finger sticks daily. </p></h4> 
            <center><img src="img/dexcom/dexcombg.jpg" style="width:40%;"></center><br><br>
 
        <h4>What is Gestational Diabetes? <br><br>
            <button type="button" class="collapsible">‚Üì &nbsp; Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) causes high blood glucose during pregnancy and affects 1 in 10 pregnant women. It is typically diagnosed between 24 and 28 weeks of pregnancy. High blood glucose causes adverse effects during pregnancy.</button>
            <div class="content">
            <p> ‚Ä¢ In the first trimester, it can cause pregnancy loss or malformations.</p>
            <p> ‚Ä¢ Later in the pregnancy, the fetus will increase insulin production as the mother‚Äôs blood glucose crosses the placenta. This can cause excessive growth of the fetus leading to labor problems and increased cesarean section. </p>
            <p> ‚Ä¢ After birth, infants are at risk of neonatal hypoglycemia (low bloodsugar), obesity, and type 2 diabetes if left untreated during pregnancy.</p>
            </div></h4>

           <br><br>

           <h4>Why is Gestational Diabetes important to manage?  <br><br>

            <p class= "para2">Gestational diabetes requires support and education about nutrition, glucose management, and its potential impacts on the fetus. Management of gestational diabetes is especially tenuous since management dependencies change throughout pregnancy as insulin tolerance increases and physicians tighten glucose ranges.</p>
            <p class= "para2"> Moreover, individual experiences vary, influencing nutritional requirements and emotional well-being, further complicating the management approach. </ul>
            </p> </h4><br>
             <h4>Who are our stakeholders? <br><br>
            <p class="para2">Our team primarily focused on women diagnosed with diabetes during pregnancy, as well as those with Type 1/2 diabetes who are also pregnant.<b> Regardless of the type of diabetes, the primary concern for these pregnant patients is the impact of their glucose management on the fetus.</b></p></h4>

        <p class="para2">For people living with diabetes, neglecting their care can be life-threatening. This risk is even greater for pregnant women, as it affects not just their health but also that of their unborn child. Consequently, gestational diabetes and glucose management often take precedence,<b> overshadowing the focus on the pregnancy itself.</b></p>

        <br>
        <p class="para2"> Our objective is to understand the experiences of pregnant women with diabetes in order to<b> design tools that manage diabetes seamlessly,</b> allowing them to focus on a healthy pregnancy. </p><br>

          <p class="para2">The team and I brainstormed on all four concepts for the next steps.
