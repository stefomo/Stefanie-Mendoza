                   <p class="para1"><p class="para1">Over 10 weeks my group and I, along with the help from mentors Gayle Lorenzi, RN, CDCES, Arizona Milotich, Dr. Lars Mueller, and Heidi Rataj designed an interactive visual tool for both healthcare provider and patients to support their learning of diabetes management.
                   <br><br><b>
				   Our mission was to make diabetes, specifically the relationship between insulin and glucose, easier to understand and manage. We wanted our project to focus on allowing people to see their diabetes in a clear, digestible way, and therefore focused on interactive visualizations as a learning tool.</b></p><br><br>

             <h1 class=" txt1"> <span class="highlight">Background </span></h1> <br>

                   <p class="para1"><p class="para1">Diabetes Technology like continous glucose monitors (CGM) and Insulin Pumps makes huge amounts of data available to people with diabetes. This data allows people to understand how diabetes affects their body and understanding this data can lead to a more effective diabetes management. However, there is little support and a lack of tools to help people with diabetes understand essential diabetes concepts.</p><br><br>

      <!--- Problem--->
            <div class="col-lg-8 center">
               <h1 class=" txt1"> <span class="highlight">Challenge </span></h1> <br>
               <p class="para1"> Living with diabetes can be stressful. On top of the physical, emotional, and financial challenges, once a person is diagnosed, there is an overwhelming amount of information they need to learn and understand quickly in order to manage a healthy lifestyle: Figuring out food intake, complex carbs, exercising, the technology, the side effects of medication, and more. <br><br>
               So what are the methods and tools people are using to learn and teach about diabetes? </p><br><br>
               <img src="img/insu/selfmade.png" class="img" alt="image of PWDs drawing out curves on paper"> <br><br><Center><p class="figure">Fig. 2. Healthcare providers explaining trends and activity.</p></Center>
               <br><br><br>
               <p class="para1"> Currently, most healthcare providers rely on pen and paper to explain insulin and glucose patterns to their patients. The patient learns in real-time but, what if they have questions? They have to book another appointment via telehealth, leaving lots of opportunity for missed education and understanding. How can we optimize these tools from paper to digital with active visualization and empower users to try it at home and on their own time? </p>
      </div>
      <div class="whitespace"></div>
 <!--- User REsearch --->
           <div class="col-lg-8 center">
               <h1 class=" txt1"> <span class="highlight">User Research</span></h1> <br>
               <p class="para1">To further understand the core problems within diabetes education, our team dove into this challenging domain by conducting research and interviews with two health care providers and four continous monitoring (CGM)/pump users to discover possible solutions for teaching and learning. 
               <br><br>
               <h5>Here are the four key insights we learned:</h5> <br>
        <!---- 1--->
              <p class="para1"><b> 1. Lack of Visual Learning Tools</b><br>
			         Healthcare providers rely on impromptu drawings to explain important concepts</p>
			   <br>
         <!---- 2--->
			      <p class="para1"><b>2. Information Overload</b><br>
               Patients expressed that when first approaching diabetes, simple is better </p>
               <p class="quotes">“It was so overwhelming. [During] the first appointment, it’s like I blacked out. I just barely remember sticking myself with a needle.”</p> <p class="pp">-Participant T, T1D and Diabetes Educator</p><br>
         <!---- 3--->
            <p class="para1"><b>3. Long Trial and Error Phase</b><br>
			  Pump users went through a long trial and error phase to understand insulin timing</p>
        <p class="quotes">“If you’re newly diagnosed, there is a lot of testing and trial and error to get to where I am. There is a steep learning curve and lots of frustrations”</p><p class="pp">-Participant M, TP1</p>
        <br>
        <!---- 4--->
			 <p class="para1"> 4. <b>Pre-Bolusing is a Challenging Concept</b><br>
			  Pre-bolusing is a relatively new concept and people are sometimes reluctant to try it.
               </p> <br>
 			<p class="para1"> <b>How might we help CGM & pump users better understand and manage 
				insulin timing and dosing? </b></p>

         <div class="col-lg-8 center">
             <h1 class=" txt1"> <span class="highlight">Ideation</span></h1> <br>
             <p class="para1">The initial ideation focused on three opportunity points gathered from the user research.</p> <br><br>
             <img src="img/insu/ideationsketch.png" class="img"><br><br>
             <Center><p class="figure">Fig. 3. Rapid ideation sketches.</p></Center><br><br>
             <h5>User Research Insights:</h5>
             <p class="para1"><b>1. Understanding Insulin Timing and Dosing</b><br>Healthcare providers stressed understanding insulin is essential.</p><br>
             <p class="para1"><b>2. Providing Personalized Care</b><br>Adjusting relevant insights and feedback to the person personalizes  their experience.</p><br>
             <p class="para1"><b>3. Using Visual Explanations</b><br>Rather than paper, simple digital interactive learning tools are better.</p><br><br>

             <p class="para1">Although there are many concepts to teach for diabetes management, we decided to focus our tool on teaching the importance of insulin timing and dosing for glucose levels. By keeping the tool simple, we are able to hone in the key insulin concept.  </p><br><center>

        <div class="whitespace"></div>
         <div class="col-lg-8 center">
        <h1 class=" txt1"> <span class="highlight">Prototype and Iterations</span></h1> <br>
        <p class="para1">Working with various healthcare providers and people with diabetes, we were able to gain valuable insights that strengthened our prototypes. The team conducted four rounds of user testing over the course of a month.</p>

        <h5>Takeaways from user testing and early iterations:</h5><br>
        <p class="para1"><b>1. Decrease Clicking</b><br>Information pop-ups were useful but increased clicking activity.</p><br>
        <p class="para1"><b>2. Simplify User Interface</b><br>‍Tool should be intuitive without a tutorial, it should not further complicate the UX.</p><br>
        <p class="para1"><b>3. Optimize Graphs</b><br>‍Graphs should be dynamic and match various insulin dose change scenarios.</p><br>
        <p class="para1"><b>4. Visualize Insulin Activity</b><br>Showing the immediate effects of insulin pushing down on glucose levels is essential to understanding patterns.</p><br>

        <p class="para1">Over four weeks of iterations, our team optimized the accuracy of our graphs, giving careful thought to terminology and providing context to the user for their best understanding.</p>

        <h1 class=" txt1"> <span class="highlight">Performance</span></h1> <br>
        <p class="para1">After our final round of user testing, we received overwhelming positive feedback from healthcare professionals and people living with diabetes.</p><br>

       <p class="quotes">“I think it’s a really cool starting point, and I can see this playing out much [bigger]...it’s very cool and useful...I don’t know if there’s anything out there like this."</p> <p class="pp">-Participant L, NP, CDE </p><br> 

        <p class="quotes">“This is also a great learning tool for health students, or anyone who’d have to care for someone with diabetes, for example, someone like a school nurse... This kind of module is simple enough that someone without diabetes could see what’s happening.” </p> <p class="pp">-Participant A, T1D and medical student</p><br> 

       <p class="quotes">“I would love to share with [someone] newly diagnosed, new on insulin or weren’t understanding through other ways of learning. This would be a good first learning tool as well as supplementary learning tool."</p> <p class="pp">-Participant E, T1D and medical professional </p><br> </div>

         <div class="col-lg-8 center">

        <p class="para1"><b>InsuLearn is the first chapter of an interactive visual book on diabetes, created by the community, for the community.</b><br><br>
      How else can we visualize to make diabetes management easier to understand? Moving forward, our users could see themselves using these tools to understand the multitude of factors in diabetes, such as the effects of exercise, complex meals, stress, pregnancy and menstrual cycles. <br><br>
      There are infinite ways design could help in further visualizing and understanding diabetes. Everybody has different visions of what a great life looks like, and implementing tools that bring users’ goals to the forefront is essential.</p><br>
