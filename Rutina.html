            <img src="img/rut/rutinaCA.png" class="img" alt="competitive analysis chart"><br><br><br>
           
            <p class="para2">There exists a wide range of innovative strategies for boosting productivity within the App Store; mostly having to do with game-ifying the idea of being productive. The versatility of many of the apps that we researched came from the absence of an actual in-app task list-&nbsp; the apps were meant to be used in conjunction with whatever the user had in mind to accomplish, but there often seems to be no space in the apps to organize these goals. </p><br>
            
            <p class="para2 x-callout2">Consequently, we propose an integration of an organizational checklist feature into our productivity app, incentivizing users to be productive by mimicking a social media platform. Our competitive advantage lies in the <u>social aspect,</u> which seems to be lacking from other productivity apps: our users can collaborate with friends on tasks while being able to keep in touch with their friends in a unique way.  </p>

            <p class="para2">To achieve the clean and sleek design we envisioned, we chose sans-serif fonts exclusively and incorporated boxes with rounded edges. A subtle drop shadow was strategically applied to add depth and dynamism without overpowering the design. Additionally, we utilized vibrant blobs of color in the backgrounds of various pages to create an inviting and playful atmosphere. Our color palette juxtaposes softer tones with bold accents of teal and yellow, ensuring a visually engaging experience throughout the app.</p><br><br>

            <p class="para2"> Seeing friends complete tasks and be productive will hopefully inspire users to do the same. We see this as a way for friends separated by distance to hold each other accountable to their responsibilities.  Additionally, we are combining some ideas of our competitors, such as implementing achievements,  reminders/notifications, and usage stats. This will allow our users to use the app to keep track of all their responsibilities, while providing them with valuable feedback on their productivity habits to allow them to make changes if necessary. </p><br><br>

            <p class="para2">Before finalizing the interface, the team conducted a second round of user testing with six users to provide us with feedback on the prototype’s usability and whether users found it purposeful. The users were given specific directions to plan their tasks and see what progress their friends have made in their tasks. </p><br>

            <p class="para2 call-out-text">The Overall Consensus</p>
             <p class="para2">The prototype was intuitive to use and it would be practical to have, especially the collaborative features which would make task projects with peers easier. 
             Although there were minor difficulties due to some connection errors within the prototype, most users were able to complete each task. At times, users felt overwhelmed by the app, so our team decided to make small changes such as reducing drop shadow, colors, and overall simplifying aspects of the design to ease users. </p><br><br>

            <p class="para2">Through this project, I leveraged design insights gained from previous classes to develop Rutina. I deepened my understanding of user research and embraced user-centered design principles through new tools and techniques. Given more time, I would have expanded the scope to include additional scenarios, tasks, and a third round of user testing to refine the updates further. </p></div>
